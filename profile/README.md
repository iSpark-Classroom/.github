## 📂 What This Org Contains

This organization is the central hub for **iSpark Classroom projects**. It is organized into two main parts:

- **Learning Projects**  
  Guided exercises and practice projects completed during the learning phase of our programs.  
  ➡️ Example: calculator apps, portfolio websites, small data analysis scripts.

- **Student Showcase**  
  Real-world projects and capstones built by students, demonstrating their skills and creativity.  
  ➡️ Example: fintech dashboards, AI models, mobile and web apps, etc.

This org doubles as both a **learning archive** and a **portfolio space** for our trainees.
